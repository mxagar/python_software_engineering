# Software Engineering Interview Questions in Python

This repository deals with data structures, algorithms, software design & Co. in python.

I created it while following the learning path [Ace the Python Coding Interview](https://www.educative.io/path/ace-python-coding-interview) in [educative.io](educative.io).

The path is divided in 7 modules, which I will add as I complete them:

1. Data Structures
2. Algorithms
3. Recursion
4. Dynamic Programming
5. Object Oriented Design
6. System Design
7. Concurrency

Each module should have a folder with a guide in it.

Another related repository of mine is [data_structures_algorithms_udemy](https://github.com/mxagar/data_structures_algorithms_udemy). I created that repository while following the Udemy course [Python for Algorithms, Data-Structures, and Interviews](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-structures-algorithms-and-interviews), by J.M. Portilla. However, that repository is more of a sandbox where I try things, so if don't expect it to be tidy and 100% PEP8-compliant :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:.
