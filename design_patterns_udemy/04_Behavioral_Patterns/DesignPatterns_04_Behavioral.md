# Design Patterns: Behavioral Patterns

This document/guide is the fourth from a set of 4 documents:

1. SOLID Design Principles
2. Creational Patterns
3. Structural Patterns
4. **Behavioral Patterns**

See the overview file [`README.md`](README.md) for more information on the origin of the guides.

Behavioral patterns don't follow any central theme, they're all different. There are overlaps in their accomplished effect, but they're implemented using different OOP mechanisms.
