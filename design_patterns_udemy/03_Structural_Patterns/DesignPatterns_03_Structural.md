# Design Patterns: Structural Patterns

This document/guide is the third from a set of 4 documents:

1. SOLID Design Principles
2. Creational Patterns
3. **Structural Patterns**
4. Behavioral Patterns

See the overview file [`README.md`](README.md) for more information on the origin of the guides.

Structural patterns are concerned with the structure of the data, i.e., class members and similar:

- Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class' inheritance.
- They put extra weight on good API design: we want to make interfaces as usable as possible.
