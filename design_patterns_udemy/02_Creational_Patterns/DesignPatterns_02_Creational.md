# Design Patterns: Creational Patterns

This document/guide is the second from a set of 4 documents:

1. SOLID Design Principles
2. **Creational Patterns**
3. Structural Patterns
4. Behavioral Patterns

See the overview file [`README.md`](README.md) for more information on the origin of the guides.

Creational patterns deal with the creation/construction of objects:

- The creation can be explicit (e.g., via constructors) of implicit (e.g., dependency injection, reflection, etc.).
- The creation can be wholesale (single statement creates the object) or piecewise, i.e., it is done step-by-step in a more complicated process.
